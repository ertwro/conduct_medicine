# Atopic Dermatitis Management

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin condition that commonly presents in both pediatric and adult populations, representing one of the most frequent dermatological consultations.



<!-- HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED: HUMANREVIEW -->

## Clinical Presentation

### Acute Phase
- **Erythema**: Red, inflamed skin
- **Vesiculation**: Small fluid-filled blisters
- **Weeping**: Serous drainage from lesions
- **Intense pruritus**: Severe itching

### Chronic Phase
- **Lichenification**: Thickened, leathery skin
- **Scaling**: Dry, flaky skin
- **Hyperpigmentation**: Darkened skin areas
- **Fissuring**: Painful skin cracks

### Age-Related Distribution

#### Infantile (2-24 months)
- Face, scalp, and extensor surfaces
- Spares diaper area typically
- Associated with food allergies

#### Childhood (2-12 years)
- Flexural areas (antecubital, popliteal fossae)
- Hands, feet, and wrists
- Less facial involvement

#### Adult (>12 years)
- Hand and foot involvement common
- Flexural areas
- Eyelid dermatitis

## Diagnostic Criteria

### Major Features (Must have 3 of 4)
1. Pruritus
2. Typical morphology and distribution
3. Chronic or relapsing course
4. Personal or family history of atopy

### Minor Features (Must have 3 of 23)
- Early age of onset
- Xerosis (dry skin)
- IgE reactivity
- Recurrent infections
- Food intolerance

## Treatment Approach

### First-Line Therapy

#### Topical Corticosteroids
- **Mild potency**: Hydrocortisone 1-2.5% (face, inframammary)
- **Medium potency**: Triamcinolone 0.1% (body, arms, legs)
- **High potency**: Fluocinonide 0.05% (thick lesions, short-term)

#### Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors
- **Tacrolimus ointment**: 0.03% (children), 0.1% (adults)
- **Pimecrolimus cream**: 1% (mild-moderate AD)
- No atrophy risk, safe for face and flexures

### Second-Line Therapy

#### Systemic Immunosuppressants
- **Dupilumab**: IL-4/IL-13 inhibitor, first-line biologic
- **Methotrexate**: Traditional systemic option
- **Cyclosporine**: For severe, refractory cases
- **Azathioprine**: Alternative systemic agent

#### JAK Inhibitors
- **Upadacitinib**: Oral JAK1 inhibitor
- **Abrocitinib**: Oral JAK1 inhibitor
- **Topical ruxolitinib**: For localized disease

### Maintenance Therapy

#### Proactive Treatment
- Intermittent topical anti-inflammatory therapy
- Applied to previously affected areas
- Prevents flare-ups and reduces disease burden

#### Skin Barrier Restoration
- **Ceramide-containing moisturizers**
- **Urea or glycerin-based emollients**
- **Petroleum-based ointments** for severe xerosis

## Trigger Management

### Environmental Factors
- Temperature and humidity control
- Avoidance of harsh soaps and detergents
- Cotton clothing, avoid wool and synthetics
- Regular cleaning to reduce dust mites

### Dietary Considerations
- Food allergy testing in severe pediatric cases
- Elimination diets under medical supervision
- Most adults do not have food triggers

### Stress Management
- Stress reduction techniques
- Adequate sleep hygiene
- Psychological support when needed

## Complications

### Secondary Bacterial Infections
- **Staphylococcus aureus**: Most common pathogen
- **Treatment**: Topical/systemic antibiotics
- **Prevention**: Proper hygiene, nail trimming

### Viral Infections
- **Eczema herpeticum**: HSV superinfection
- **Molluscum contagiosum**: More frequent in AD patients
- **Eczema vaccinatum**: Vaccinia virus complication

### Contact Sensitization
- Increased risk due to barrier dysfunction
- Patch testing in refractory cases
- Avoidance of known allergens

## Monitoring and Follow-up

### Disease Severity Assessment
- **EASI score**: Eczema Area and Severity Index
- **SCORAD**: Scoring Atopic Dermatitis
- **IGA**: Investigator Global Assessment
- **DLQI**: Dermatology Life Quality Index

### Treatment Monitoring
- Regular assessment of treatment response
- Side effect monitoring for systemic agents
- Laboratory monitoring for immunosuppressants

### Long-term Management
- Education about chronic nature
- Recognition of flare triggers
- Appropriate step-up/step-down therapy
- Quality of life assessment

- Calcineurin inhibitors: Limited data, use with caution
- Systemic agents: Risk-benefit assessment required

### Elderly Patients
- Increased risk of skin atrophy
- Polypharmacy considerations
- Comorbidity management
