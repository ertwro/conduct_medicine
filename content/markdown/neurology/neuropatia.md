# The Primary Care Guide to Peripheral Neuropathy

This guide provides a systematic, evidence-based framework for the assessment and management of peripheral neuropathy in the primary care setting. It integrates a practical, triage-based approach with deeper clinical context to improve diagnostic accuracy and management.

## **Part 1: The Critical Triage Tool (Red Flags First)**

A standardized assessment is critical to identify variations that signal a more serious or treatable diagnosis. The presence of one or more of the following flags mandates the Urgent/Atypical Pathway (Plan A). The absence of all flags indicates the Standard DSPN Pathway (Plan B) is appropriate.

| Red Flag                             | Brief Definition & Clinical Significance                                                                                                                    |
| :----------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Acute or Subacute Onset**          | Symptoms developing over days to weeks. Suggests an inflammatory or vasculitic cause.                                                                       |
| **Asymmetry**                        | Symptoms or exam findings are unequal between sides. Raises concern for mononeuropathy multiplex, radiculopathy, or ganglionopathy.                         |
| **Non-Length-Dependent Pattern**     | Symptoms begin in the hands, trunk, or face, or appear in a patchy distribution. Inconsistent with typical metabolic neuropathies.                          |
| **Predominantly Motor Features**     | Weakness is significantly more prominent than sensory symptoms. **This is the cardinal feature of CIDP** and other motor neuropathies.                      |
| **Predominantly Autonomic Features** | Severe orthostasis, gastroparesis, or sweating dysfunction outweighs sensory/motor symptoms. Can be a clue for amyloidosis.                                 |
| **Prominent Sensory Ataxia**         | Severe imbalance and frequent falls due to profound loss of joint position sense (proprioception). Hallmark of a sensory ganglionopathy or DADS neuropathy. |
| **Diffuse Areflexia**                | Absent reflexes throughout (upper and lower limbs). A key non-length-dependent sign concerning for inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathies.             |

## **Part 2: Analysis and Plan**

### **Template A: Patient WITH ≥1 Red Flag (Atypical Neuropathy)**

**Assessment:**
This patient presents with an **Atypical Peripheral Neuropathy**, characterized by [list specific red flags, e.g., subacute onset and motor predominance]. This presentation is concerning for an underlying inflammatory (e.g., CIDP, vasculitis), paraneoplastic (e.g., sensory ganglionopathy), compressive, or hereditary etiology and requires urgent specialist evaluation.

- **Clinical Pearl:** The diagnosis of _Typical CIDP_ requires **progressive, symmetric, proximal and distal weakness** developing over at least 8 weeks. A presentation without significant weakness is highly unlikely to be CIDP.

**Plan:**

1.  **Diagnostics:** Order **EMG and Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS)**. This is a **high-yield test** when red flag features are present to confirm the pattern and identify features of demyelination, axonal loss, or conduction block.
2.  **Referral:** Place an **urgent referral to Neurology**.
3.  **Initial Labs (Consider Pending Referral):** Depending on the specific red flags, consider ordering a paraneoplastic antibody panel, SPEP, HIV test, and markers of inflammation (ESR, CRP) to expedite the workup.
4.  **Follow-up:** Will contact the patient with results and confirm neurology appointment details.

---

### **Template B: Patient with NO Red Flags (Standard DSPN Pathway)**

**Assessment:**
This patient presents with a **Chronic, Symmetric, Length-Dependent, Sensory-Predominant Polyneuropathy (DSPN)**. This clinical phenotype is most consistent with a systemic toxic or metabolic process. The initial workup is aimed at identifying common and/or reversible causes. Even with a complete workup, **18-25% of such cases remain idiopathic**.

**Plan:**

**1. The EMG/NCS Decision:**
Per AANEM Guidelines, EMG/NCS is considered **low-yield** and can be deferred if all of the following are true: 1) Mild, symmetric, distal, sensory-predominant findings, 2) A **known cause** for the neuropathy is already present (e.g., long-standing diabetes), and 3) There is low suspicion for a coexisting disorder (e.g., radiculopathy).

- Conversely, EMG/NCS is **high-yield** in a new case of DSPN _without_ a clear cause, as studies show it can reveal an alternative diagnosis (like radiculopathy) in up to 31.5% of cases.

**2. Diagnostic Workup: Focused, High-Yield Labs**
_A thorough history is the highest-yield diagnostic tool, capable of identifying the cause in over 60% of cases (e.g., diabetes, alcohol abuse, chemotherapy history)._

| Test                                       | Clinical Pertinence / Key Facts                                                                                                               |
| :----------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HbA1c**                                  | To screen for diabetes and pre-diabetes. **Impaired glucose tolerance is the most common cause of DSPN**.                                     |
| **Vitamin B12 Level (with reflex to MMA)** | To screen for B12 deficiency. Including MMA significantly increases diagnostic sensitivity for borderline cases.                              |
| **SPEP with Immunofixation**               | **A monoclonal gammopathy is found in 10% of patients with DSPN**. Immunofixation is essential for sensitivity. See below for interpretation. |
| **TSH**                                    | To screen for hypothyroidism, a treatable metabolic cause.                                                                                    |
| **HIV Test**                               | HIV can cause a painful sensory neuropathy and is an important diagnosis to consider.                                                         |

**3. Interpreting a Positive Monoclonal Gammopathy (SPEP) Result:**

- **Context is Key:** Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance (MGUS) is common (1% of population) and the risk increases with age. In a patient with classic DSPN, an IgG or IgA M-spike is **most likely a coincidental finding**.
- **Action Plan:**
  1.  **Priority 1: Rule out Multiple Myeloma.** Order CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel (calcium, creatinine), and refer to Hematology for further risk stratification.
  2.  **Neuropathy Management:** If myeloma is excluded, the MGUS itself does not change the management of the DSPN.
  3.  **Red Flags for Causality:** If the neuropathy phenotype includes **prominent pain/autonomic features (amyloidosis concern)** or **severe sensory ataxia (DADS/IgM neuropathy concern)**, the link is more likely, and urgent Neurology/Hematology input is critical.

**4. Special Consideration: Isolated Small-Fiber Neuropathy (SFN)**

- **Presentation:** Patients report severe burning/stabbing pain but have a **normal neurologic exam** (strength, reflexes, vibration are intact). Only pinprick/temperature sensation may be reduced. EMG/NCS is normal.
- **Diagnosis:** The gold standard is a **skin biopsy** showing reduced epidermal nerve fiber density. This is useful when the diagnosis is uncertain.
- **Etiology:** The workup is similar to DSPN, but the association with **impaired glucose tolerance is even stronger**.
- **Management:** **Intensive diet and exercise** has been shown to be disease-modifying, leading to nerve fiber regeneration. This should be a primary focus.

**5. Symptomatic Pain Management:**

- **Patient Counseling:** Counsel that finding an effective agent often **requires trial and error**. Start low and titrate slowly. Combining agents from different classes can be effective for refractory pain.
- **AAN Guideline First-Line Options (Initiate ONE):**
  - **SNRIs:** Duloxetine (start 30mg daily, increase to 60mg after 1 week).
  - **TCAs:** Nortriptyline (start 10mg qHS, increase by 10mg every 1-2 weeks).
  - **Gabapentinoids:** Gabapentin (start 300mg qHS, titrate up to 900-1800mg/day in 3 divided doses; requires renal adjustment).
- **Topical Options:** Consider lidocaine or capsaicin patches/creams.
- **Clinical Pitfall: Avoid Opiates.** The use of opiates for chronic neuropathic pain is strongly discouraged as it is associated with worse functional outcomes and high risks of dependence and overdose.

**6. Follow-up & Second-Line Workup:**

- Schedule follow-up in 4-6 weeks to review labs and assess medication.
- If initial workup is negative and symptoms progress, refer to Neurology and consider second-pass testing for less common causes like **Celiac Disease, Sjögren's Syndrome, Sarcoidosis, or hereditary TTR amyloidosis**.

## **Part 3: Comprehensive Data Gathering (The Full Clinical Record)**

_Use this section as a guide to perform and document the complete history and exam needed to support the Assessment and Plan you selected in Part 2._

### **3.1 Administrative & History**

- **Patient Identifiers:** Full Name, DOB, MRN.
- **Encounter Details:** Date and Time of Visit.
- **Source & Reliability of History:**
- **Chief Complaint (CC):** (e.g., `"Burning pain in my feet for 6 months."`)

### **3.2 History of Present Illness (HPI)**

_This section systematically gathers the data needed to screen for the Red Flags._

- **Time Course:** _"Did symptoms begin suddenly over days to weeks (acute/subacute), or gradually over months or years (chronic)?"_
- **Symmetry:** _"Are symptoms identical on both sides, or is one side worse?"_
- **Pattern of Involvement:** _"Did symptoms start in your toes and slowly move up your legs? Did they reach your knees before your hands became affected?"_
  - A **non-length-dependent pattern** (e.g., simultaneous onset in feet and hands) is a red flag.
- **Neurologic Modalities Involved:**
  - **Motor Query:** _"Is your main problem weakness or muscle cramps?"_
  - **Large Fiber Sensory Query:** _"Is your main problem numbness, tingling, or imbalance leading to falls?"_
  - **Small Fiber Sensory Query:** _"Is your main problem burning/stabbing pain?"_
  - **Autonomic Query:** _"Do you have issues with dizziness on standing, early satiety, sweating, or bladder/sexual function?"_

### **3.3 Past and Family History**

- **Past Medical History:** Query for known causes of DSPN: Diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, chemotherapy history, thyroid disorders, HIV, known monoclonal gammopathies, celiac disease, sarcoidosis, and Sjögren's syndrome.
- **Family History:** Query for family members with similar symptoms or with characteristic foot deformities like high arches or hammertoes, which suggest a hereditary cause.

### **3.4 The Focused Neuropathy Examination**

- **Sensory:** Test vibration and pinprick at the L4 (medial malleolus), L5 (first web space), and S1 (lateral foot) dermatomes to confirm a length-dependent gradient.
- **Reflexes:** Check ankle and knee jerk reflexes, noting asymmetry (clue for radiculopathy) or hyperreflexia (a critical sign of myelopathy, a mimic).
- **Special Tests:** A positive **Romberg Test** (unsteadiness with eyes closed) indicates large fiber sensory (proprioceptive) dysfunction.
- **Exclude Mimics:**
  - **Plantar Fasciitis:** Palpate for tenderness at the plantar fascia insertion. Pain is often worse with the first steps in the morning.
  - **Lumbosacral Radiculopathy:** Look for asymmetry in sensory loss or reflexes.
  - **Cervical Myelopathy:** Look for upper motor neuron signs (hyperreflexia, spasticity).

## **Part 4: Appendix - A Guide to Neuropathy Patterns**

This section provides a clinical summary of common neuropathy patterns. Each pattern has a distinct "shape" of sensory or motor loss that provides a crucial clue to the underlying location of the problem.

### **1. Distal Symmetric Polyneuropathy (DSPN)**

- **Pattern:** Symmetrical and length-dependent **"stocking-glove"** distribution. Symptoms start in the toes and ascend the legs before affecting the hands.
- **Clinical Findings:**
  - _Large-fiber type:_ Prominent numbness, loss of vibration/proprioception, and diminished reflexes.
  - _Small-fiber type:_ Prominent burning pain and allodynia, with preserved reflexes and strength.
- **Common Causes:** Metabolic (diabetes, hypothyroidism), Toxic (alcohol, chemotherapy), Nutritional (B12 deficiency).

### **2. Mononeuropathy (Focal / Entrapment)**

- **Pattern:** Deficits are confined to the distribution of a **single nerve**, often at a compression site.
- **Clinical Findings:** Pain, paresthesias, and weakness in the specific nerve's territory.
- **Common Causes:** Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (Median n.), Cubital Tunnel Syndrome (Ulnar n.), Common Peroneal Neuropathy at the fibular head (causes foot drop).

### **3. Mononeuropathy Multiplex**

- **Pattern:** **Asymmetric, patchy, and sequential** involvement of two or more non-contiguous nerves. This is a major red flag.
- **Clinical Findings:** A left foot drop followed weeks later by a right wrist drop is a classic example.
- **Common Causes:** Systemic Vasculitis (e.g., Polyarteritis Nodosa), Infectious (Lyme, HIV), Inflammatory (Sarcoidosis).

### **4. Radiculopathy**

- **Pattern:** Deficits follow a specific **dermatome** (sensory) and **myotome** (motor).
- **Clinical Findings:** Sharp, lancinating pain that radiates. For an L5 radiculopathy, expect sensory loss in the medial foot/great toe and weakness of ankle dorsiflexion.
- **Common Causes:** Nerve Root Compression (herniated disc), Infectious (shingles), Inflammatory.

### **5. Proximal Motor Neuropathy (Diabetic Amyotrophy)**

- **Pattern:** Asymmetric deficits in the **proximal legs** (thighs, hips, buttocks).
- **Clinical Findings:** Severe pain and weakness in the thighs, often with significant muscle wasting.
- **Common Causes:** Almost exclusively seen in Type 2 Diabetes, often after poor glycemic control or weight loss.

### **6. Central Cord Syndrome**

- **Pattern:** A **"cape-like"** or "suspended" sensory loss across the shoulders and arms, with relative sparing of the legs.
- **Clinical Findings:** "Dissociated" sensory loss, where pain and temperature are affected more than light touch or vibration.
- **Common Causes:** Spinal Cord Lesion (Syringomyelia, trauma, tumor).
